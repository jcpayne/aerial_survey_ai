    "## Goal of this notebook\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to train an AI model to detect small features (animals) in large images (aerial photographs).  The relatively poor quality of the aerial images means that we can't afford to reduce the image resolution without losing the features we want to detect.  This is generically called a \"small-object detection\" problem and is an active area of research.  The way the problem is generally handled is to cut large images into smaller 'tiles'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are roughly 6000 x 4000 pixels and we plan to use a tile size of 500 x 500, which means we will have 12 x 8 = 96 tiles per image, i.e., roughly 100 times as many tiles as images.  Even in the training images that contain objects of interest, the objects usually fall in just a few tiles.  For training purposes, there is no benefit to feeding the model vast numbers of empty tiles, but the model may generalize better if _some_ empty tiles are included in the training data.  Tiling images also requires that the corresponding bounding box annotations must be chopped up appropriately (transforming coordinates and preserving information about the class, attributes, etc.), and introduces the problem of boxes that fall across boundaries between tiles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The specific goals of this notebook were:**\n",
    "1. To make sure that all images (including empty ones) have annotation files;\n",
    "2. To cut the images into tiles, and to tile the corresponding bounding boxes appropriately;\n",
    "3. To allow overlap between tiles to ameliorate the problem of bounding boxes that fall on tile boundaries;\n",
    "4. To omit most empty tiles and to save CPU cycles by not processing them, but allow some fraction of them to be sampled at random; and\n",
    "5. To make it possible to discard tiles or change the label to \"none\" based on a threshold for minimum bounding box area."

    "1. The original package discarded any pixels that fall outside an even multiple of the tile size.  That wastes a lot of data if the tiles are large.  Each image is now padded with zeros out to an even multiple of tile size _before_ tiling it so no data is lost, and the padding works correctly if the images are of different sizes.  \n",
    "2. The tile overlap math, tile size calculations, and row and column indexes were fixed to make them precisely correct (instead of various rough approximations, truncations, etc.);\n",
    "3. Fixed a problem with float values in annotations that caused a display error;\n",
    "4. Built in the capability to sample a variable proportion of empty tiles;\n",
    "5. Revamped tile naming so that tiles are named with row and column indexes to make future reassembly easier.\n",
    "6. Modified the code so tiles that are not saved are not created in the first place, to save memory and CPU cycles;\n",
    "7. Made the tiled images display in the correct row and column relative to the original image, and to show padding (the placement of tiles in the original package was approximate, relative to the source image).\n",
    "8. Images (but not yet annotations) can now be found by recursive search; i.e., the `im_src` directory can be pointed at a parent directory that contains subdirectories with images in them.\n",
    "9. Bounding boxes fragments that are smaller than tile overlap in the appropriate dimension can be excluded (see next)"

    "## Excluding bounding box fragments\n",
    "The problem: When tiling images to generate training data, the associated bounding boxes must also be tiled.  Splitting bounding boxes across tiles creates box fragments on one side of a tile boundary.  For a deep learning model, it is desirable to exclude small box fragments because they are very unlikely to contain a recognizable object. Overlapping the tiles helps to reduce the problem, but does not eliminate fragments.  \n",

    "**The method implemented here allows the user to ensure that no feature smaller than the tile overlap will be excluded, while getting rid of all smaller fragments.**\n",

    "In the diagram below, the large box is a tile and the overlap with adjacent tiles is shown by dotted lines. The `exclude_fragments=True` option would exclude all three bounding boxes shown below in yellow (A, B, and C) from the tile.  For simplicity, bounding boxes are only shown on the bottom and right of the tile in the image, but the behavior is identical for the top and left edges of the tile, respectively.\n",

    "**Decision rule:**\n",
    "Given that a rectangular bounding box can have 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3) corners inside a rectangular tile if they are aligned:\n",
    "- If 1 corner of the box is in the tile: \n",

Box D will be recorded in this tile only; box E will be sliced in half and will be recorded (with overlap) in this tile and the tile below it.  Box F will be recorded in both this tile and the tile below it.  Box G will appear on this tile and in the tile to the right of it (minus the part to the left of the dotted line). Boxes A, B and C will not be recorded in this tile, but _will_ be recorded on adjacent tiles.  \n"
