    "# Organizing images and annotations\n",
    "## How not to do it\n",
    "One of the most time-consuming aspects of machine learning is assembling training data that have a good balance between object categories and as much diversity as possible in image backgrounds.  **This notebook is really a master class in how _not_ to do it, because I failed to insist on a high enough level of organization early in the project. I am including it as a cautionary tale.** \n",
    "\n",
    "I started with: \n",
    "- An annotation format (Pascal-VOC) that requires an exact 1:1 match between images and annotations; \n",
    "- A very complicated folder structure for images, which mixed images that had been analyzed by a human with images that had never been examined;\n",
    "- A bunch of zip files with annotations whose filepaths didn't exactly match the image filepaths; and \n",
    "- Annotations from a program called CVAT that didn't produce output for empty images (therefore, it was challenging to figure out which had been examined).\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a ghastly nightmare to straighten it all out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to do it better\n",
    "To make the AI side of the project go smoothly, it will greatly help to insist on the following:\n",
    "1. **Unique names for images**.  This is absolutely worth doing, even if it takes time to set up.\n",
    "2. **A simple folder structure**.  Regardless of whatever complexity you may have in the initial stages of data collection, by the time you get to input for an AI model, you want _only two folders_ : 1) images, and 2) matching annotations.  There should be no extraneous files in either folder.\n",
    "3. **An annotation program whose output makes it possible to tell whether a file has been checked, even if there was nothing in it.** If you working with Pascal-VOC annotation, then you want it to provide an XML annnotation file for every image, _including_ 'empty' images.\n",
    "4. **Come to agreement soon on object categories**.  You probably won't have enough images to train the model on some categories.  It may make sense to lump or drop those categories, and it saves time to experiment and come to agreement on a final set before getting serious about training.  Adding or subtracting categories requires re-training the model head (at a minimum) so it is expensive to do it too late.  In addition, the raw annotations will undoubtedly include many that don't fall into your permitted categories.  Those can be handled during the dataloading process, but it is a good idea to anticipate and discuss how to handle them in advance."
